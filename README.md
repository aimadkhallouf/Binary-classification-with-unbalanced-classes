# Binary-classification-with-unbalanced-classes
Telemarketing campaigns have been used by retail banks to sell products. During these campaigns, bank agents contact a list of clients using phone calls and try to convince them to subscribe to a term deposit. Thus, the calls are either successful or unsuccessful.

The dataset I am studying here is provided by a Portuguese banking institution. There is a total of 41188 contacts from May 2008 to November 2010. The dataset is unbalanced since only about 11.3% of contacts have been successful.

The aim of this study is to build predictive models to target the clients who are more likely to subscribe. In another words, make these camapigns more efficient.

Using a jupyter notebook, I am going to cover all the basic steps of a Machine Learning project:

1. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization
2. Data preperation
3. Feature selection
4. Modeling
5. Evaluations
